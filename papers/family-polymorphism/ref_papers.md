Family polymorphism
====

The main goal is to create a study related to family polymorphism as part of a school project.

Tasks
====
- [] Study different types of polymorphism
- [] Put family poly. in place opposed to the other types
- [] Collect recent research papers related this topic
- [] Create the study, stuff learned till this
- [] Create timeline, considering the class schedule
- [] Create class material from the study
- [] Publish ? (Find a proper place to publish.)
